# Stacked-ensemble-of-heterogeneous-Deep-Learners-for-robust-NIDS
Building a meta-learner (LightGBM / Small MLP) by stacking an ensemble of heterogeneous Deep Learning models (1-D CNN, Bi-LSTM and Transformer) to combine predictions and, thereby, improve the generalization and robustness capabilities of the end-model.
